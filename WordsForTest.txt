The concept of sovereign grace claims that all men were plunged under sin when Adam sinned, and were not capable of doing good or believing in God (ROMANS 8:6-8; ROMANS 3:9-12, 23) except for those that God chose to save before the world began, before the foundation of the world (2 TIMOTHY 1:9; TITUS 1:2; EPHESIANS 1:4; JOHN 17:24). See also JOHN 8:24-27! :)
